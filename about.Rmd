Hello!

I am a tinkerer with a consulting (financial risk, sales operations) background that [teaches R](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnDEAy0fiVqxipyph_1lA_Beer_Fc8s0l) and solves data problems from time to time. 

If you want to chat, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter [\@datasalaryman](https://twitter.com/datasalaryman), or send me an [email](mailto:jgendrinal@up.edu.ph) at jgendrinal@up.edu.ph.
